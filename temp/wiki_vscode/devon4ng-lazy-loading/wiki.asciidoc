= Boost Angularâ€™s Performance by Lazy Loading your Modules with devon4ng
== Learn how to defer initialization of modules in Angular until it is needed 
In single-page-applications as the application size increases its loading speed decreases (since typically the entire application is loaded at once). Lazy loading is a design pattern that defers initialization of objects until it is needed. Angular handles lazy loading through the routing module which redirects to requested pages. Those pages can be loaded at start or on demand. In this tutorial you will build a simple app to understand how lazyloading is implemented in Angular.


## Prerequisites

* Basic Angular knowledge


## Learning goals
In this tutorial you will learn how to:

* create an Angular application using the devon command

* look how all modules are loaded by an application at the begining (eager loading)

* implement lazy loading and understand its concept and advantages

=== devonfw setup



If you already installed the devonfw IDE, you can skip this step.

==== Prerequisites

* You need to have a tool to extract `.tar.gz` files. On Windows lower Windows 10 use can use https://www.7-zip.org/7-zip[7-Zip]. The most other platforms support this feature by default.
* You need to have https://git-scm.com/[Git] and https://curl.se/[Curl] installed. On Windows you have to install https://git-scm.com/download/win[Git for Windows]. On Linux systems you might need to install the following tools in case they are not present (`sudo apt-get install git curl` or `sudo yum install git-core curl`)

Create a new directory in the location where you want to install the devonfw IDE. If you are using the terminal, navigate to this location and run `mkdir devonfw` and `cd devonfw` to create the directory and navigate into it.

==== Download



Now you have to download the latest release of the devonfw IDE. You can download it from https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz[here].

In the Terminal execute `Invoke-WebRequest -OutFile devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz 'https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz'` if you are using Windows.

On Linux use `wget -c 'https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz' -O devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz -`.

On MacOS, depending on your setup, you can either use the same `wget` command specified for the Linux installation (install wget via homebrew `brew install wget`) or use any other available download command i.e. `curl -o devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz`.



After that you need to extract the downloaded file. To do this, run `tar -xvzf devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz`. Or you can simply use a tool (e.g. 7-Zip) for this.

==== Setup

First, you need to prepare a settings repository to specify the tools to be installed within the devonfw IDE. Normally this is done by your project. If you just want to test the devonfw IDE, you can use the default URL, which is https://github.com/devonfw/ide-settings.

For now clone the repository on https://github.com/devonfw/ide-settings or your own fork of it.
For this tutorial you have to write `DEVON_IDE_TOOLS=(npm ng vscode)` into the devon.properties file of the cloned settings repository. These settings will now be passed into the installation process of the devonfw-ide.
Start the setup process by executing `.\setup 'path/to/settings'` (Windows) or `bash setup path/to/settings.git` (Linux).

You can also just execute `.\setup` (Windows) or `bash setup` (Linux) and press Enter when the setup assistent asks for the URL to the settings repository. This will also download the default settings and install the default tools within the devonfw IDE.

 



== Enable routing with router-outlet
In the file app.component.html delete all the content and put in the `router-outlet` tag.


=== Changing of the app.component.html File

In the file app.component.html delete all the content and put in the `router-outlet` tag.


==== Prerequisites
* VS Code Editor (can be installed in your devonfw environment).

==== Changing of app.component.html in the VS Code Editor

To change the file app.component.html, you have to open it in VS Code first. 
Open VS Code and choose in the *File* context menu in the top left corner right next to the VS Code symbol *Open File...* or just use the keyboard shortcut ctrl+o. 
Based on your operating system a window with the file explorer opens. You have to navigate to app.component.html and select it. Choose the right folder manually by selecting the folders from the path `devonfw/workspaces/main/level-app/src/app` and select the file `app.component.html`. 
You can confirm this with the *Open* button in the bottom right corner and app.component.html will be opened in a new VS Code editor window.

Copy the following text.
[source, ]
----
<router-outlet></router-outlet>
----

Now insert the copied text into the opened app.component.html. 
The final step is to save the file by selecting *Save* in the file context menu or by using the keyboard shortcut ctrl+s and app.component.html has been changed.



== Create the modules and their components
Next you will create the feature modules and components for the app. You will follow the structure shown in the image in the first step. You can use the CLI command `devon ng generate module` along with the `--routing` flag to generate the modules, and `devon ng generate component` command to generate the components.

== Configure routing
To move between the components you will now configure the routes. You can refer the image in the first step to understand how you will configure the routes.
In `app-routing.module.ts` you will add a path 'first' to `FirstComponent` and a redirection from '' to 'first'. And then import the `FirstModule` in the main `app.module.ts`

Next, for the feature modules, you will add the routes 'first/second-left' and 'first/second-right' pointing to their respective `ContentComponent` in `first-routing.module.ts`. And then import `SecondLeftModule` and `SecondRightModule` in `first.module.ts`

== Eager loading vs Lazy Loading
If you run the project at this point you can see in the terminal that just the main file is built.
![compile-eager](./assets/compile-eager.png)

Go to port 4200 and check the Network tab in the Developer Tools. We can see a document named "first" is loaded. If you click on [Go to right module] a second level module opens, but there is no 'second-right' document.
![second-lvl-right-eager](./assets/second-lvl-right-eager.png)

Now we will modify the app to lazily load the modules. Modifying an angular application to load its modules lazily is easy, you have to change the routing configuration of the desired module (for example `FirstModule`). Instead of loading a component, you dynamically import it in a `loadChildren` attribute because modules acts as gates to access components "inside" them. Updating this app to load lazily has four consecuences: no component attribute, no import of `FirstComponent`, `FirstModule` import has to be removed from the imports array at `app.module.ts`, and change of context.

Also, in `first-routing.module.ts` you can change the path for the `ContentComponent`s from `first/second-left` and `first/second-right` to simply `second-left` and `second-right` respectively,  because it aquires the context set by AppRoutingModule.

== Lazily load the second left module
Now when you check the terminal running the app, you could see the lazy loaded modules getting generated along with the main bundle. Also, if you check the Network tab in the developer tools, you could see the (lazy) modules getting loaded when needed. Since, `FirstModule` is the first path we visit, it is getting loaded at first only.
![compile-first-lazy](./assets/compile-first-lazy.png)
![first-lvl-lazy](./assets/first-lvl-lazy.png)

Now, lets make the SecondLeftModule load lazily. For this, you need to change `component` to `loadChildren` and refer `SecondLeftModule` in the file `first-routing.module.ts`. Next, you need to remove `SecondLeftModule` from the `imports` array of `first.module.ts`. After that you need to route the `ContentComponent` within the `second-left-routing.module.ts`.

== Conclusion


Lazy loading is a pattern useful when new features are added, these features are usually identified as modules which can be loaded only if needed as shown in this tutorial, reducing the time spent loading an application.
