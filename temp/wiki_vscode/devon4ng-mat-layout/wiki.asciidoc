=== devonfw setup



If you already installed the devonfw IDE, you can skip this step.

==== Prerequisites

* You need to have a tool to extract `.tar.gz` files. On Windows lower Windows 10 use can use https://www.7-zip.org/7-zip[7-Zip]. The most other platforms support this feature by default.
* You need to have https://git-scm.com/[Git] and https://curl.se/[Curl] installed. On Windows you have to install https://git-scm.com/download/win[Git for Windows]. On Linux systems you might need to install the following tools in case they are not present (`sudo apt-get install git curl` or `sudo yum install git-core curl`)

Create a new directory in the location where you want to install the devonfw IDE. If you are using the terminal, navigate to this location and run `mkdir devonfw` and `cd devonfw` to create the directory and navigate into it.

==== Download



Now you have to download the latest release of the devonfw IDE. You can download it from https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz[here].

In the Terminal execute `Invoke-WebRequest -OutFile devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz 'https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz'` if you are using Windows.

On Linux use `wget -c 'https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz' -O devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz -`.

On MacOS, depending on your setup, you can either use the same `wget` command specified for the Linux installation (install wget via homebrew `brew install wget`) or use any other available download command i.e. `curl -o devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz`.



After that you need to extract the downloaded file. To do this, run `tar -xvzf devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz`. Or you can simply use a tool (e.g. 7-Zip) for this.

==== Setup

First, you need to prepare a settings repository to specify the tools to be installed within the devonfw IDE. Normally this is done by your project. If you just want to test the devonfw IDE, you can use the default URL, which is https://github.com/devonfw/ide-settings.

For now clone the repository on https://github.com/devonfw/ide-settings or your own fork of it.
For this tutorial you have to write `DEVON_IDE_TOOLS=(npm ng vscode)` into the devon.properties file of the cloned settings repository. These settings will now be passed into the installation process of the devonfw-ide.
Start the setup process by executing `.\setup 'path/to/settings'` (Windows) or `bash setup path/to/settings.git` (Linux).

You can also just execute `.\setup` (Windows) or `bash setup` (Linux) and press Enter when the setup assistent asks for the URL to the settings repository. This will also download the default settings and install the default tools within the devonfw IDE.

 



== Import Material components
Once the dependencies are installed, you need to import the BrowserAnimationsModule in your AppModule for animations support.
Also, Angular Material provides a host of components for designing your application. All the components are well structured into NgModules. For each component from the Angular Material library that you want to use, you have to import the respective NgModule.

  <button mat-button [matMenuTriggerFor]="submenu">Menu 1</button>
  <button mat-button>Menu 2</button>
  <button mat-button>Menu 3</button>

  <mat-menu #submenu="matMenu">
    <button mat-menu-item>Sub-menu 1</button>
    <button mat-menu-item [matMenuTriggerFor]="submenu2">Sub-menu 2</button>
  </mat-menu>

  <mat-menu #submenu2="matMenu">
    <button mat-menu-item>Menu Item 1</button>

Now insert the copied text into the opened app.component.html. 
The final step is to save the file by selecting *Save* in the file context menu or by using the keyboard shortcut ctrl+s and app.component.html has been changed.

The color attribute on the mat-toolbar element will give it the primary (indigo) color as defined by your theme. The color attribute works with most Angular Material components; the possible values are `primary`, `accent` and `warn`. The `mat-toolbar` is a suitable component to represent a header. It serves as a placeholder for elements you want in your header. Inside the `mat-toolbar`, you start with a button having `mat-icon-button` attribute, which itself contains a `mat-icon` element having the value `menu`. This will serve as a menu button which you can use to toggle the `sidenav`. You follow it with some sample buttons having the `mat-button` attribute. Notice the first button has a property `matMenuTriggerFor` binded to a local reference submenu. As the property name suggests, the click of this button will display the mat-menu element with the specified local reference as a drop-down menu. The rest of the code is self explanatory.


== Shift header menu buttons to right
You want to keep the sidenav toggling menu button on the left and move the rest to the right to make it look better. To do this add the following style to the `menu` class in `app.component.scss`:

== Create navigatable pages
Next, you will create a sidenav. But before that lets create a couple of components to navigate between, the links of which you will add to the sidenav. You can use the `ng generate component` (or `ng g c` command for short) to create Home and Data components. But here, you will create them manually. You nest them in the `pages` sub-directory since they represent your pages. And you will also add the new components to your AppModule.

== Create the sidenav
Let us finally create the sidenav. To implement the sidenav you need to use 3 Angular Material components: `mat-sidenav-container`, `mat-sidenav` and `mat-sidenav-content`. The `mat-sidenav-container`, as the name suggests, acts as a container for the `sidenav` and the associated content. So it is the parent element, and `mat-sidenav` and `mat-sidenav-content` are the children sibling elements. `mat-sidenav` represents the sidenav. You can put any content you want, though it is usually used to conatain a list of navigational links. The `mat-sidenav-content` element is for conataining your main page content. Since you need the `sidenav` application-wide, you will put it in the `app.component.html`
